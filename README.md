# lambda-cron-backup-s3

lambda-cron-backup-s3 is a project developed as part of the [Full-stack courses at from zero to fullstack](https://fromzerotofullstack.com/courses/lambda-cron-backup-s3/)

We will use the AWS CDK in Typescript to create a Lambda function and its resources, and schedule it at specific intervals. We will use this lambda to perform regular database backups of a server outside of AWS.
